This HTML file creates a simple webpage with a button and a paragraph. The paragraph initially displays red-colored text. When the button is clicked, a JavaScript function (changeTextAndColor) is triggered. This function changes the paragraph's text to "The text and color have been changed!" and updates its color to blue. The webpage includes inline CSS for the initial styling and a <script> block for the JavaScript functionality.
